convo0001	seraph_excited	Seraph	Looks like the whole city is F'd in the A with a D		
convo0001	alex_neutral	AL-X	Those acronyms do not compute. The Grid is defintley encountering a bug.		
convo0002	alex_neutral	AL-X	Seraph, the Grid has been disrupted. There are failures in the flooring tiles. 		
convo0002	seraph_excited	Seraph	Now THAT'S a big hole!		
convo0003	alex_neutral	AL-X	Seraph, you will not be able to walk across that gap. Try your dash technique. 		
convo0003	seraph_excited	Seraph	I prefer to call it a gliding duck walk		
convo0003b	alex_neutral	AL-X	Excellent job! Nice achievement. 		
convo0003b	seraph_excited	Seraph	This dry robot thing is played out. Dial up the sass.		
convo0003b	alex_neutral	AL-X	Slaaaay Bitch!!!		
convo0003b	seraph_excited	Seraph	Back three clicks. 		
convo0003b	alex_neutral	AL-X	Werk, gurl!		
convo0003b	seraph_excited	Seraph	Noice. 		
convo0004	alex_neutral	AL-X	That trash can is a bit phish. 		
convo0004	seraph_excited	Seraph	Oh snap! That can is shooting trash at me!		
convo0004	alex_neutral	AL-X	Try disconnecting it from the Grid.		
convo0005	seraph_excited	Seraph	Step off, bitch.		
convo0005	alex_neutral	AL-X	That seems to have worked.		
convo0005	seraph_excited	Seraph	You put the 'rash' in trash.		
convo0005	alex_neutral	AL-X	lol		
convo0005	seraph_excited	Seraph	Don't be cute.		
convo0006	alex_neutral	AL-X	Seraph, this does not appear to be an isolated case. All of the bots in Bavelle appear to be malfunctioning.		
convo0006	seraph_excited	Seraph	So much for going dancing tonightâ€¦		
convo0007	alex_neutral	AL-X	You cannot access that bot to disconnect it from the Grid. Best to avoid its projectiles. 		
convo0007	seraph_excited	Seraph	But projectiles are the best part.		
convo0008	seraph_excited	Seraph	Aren't you cute - want a hug little guy?		
convo0008	alex_neutral	AL-X	These bots are not friendly.		
convo0008	seraph_excited	Seraph	First you surge then you purge? What sort of Cleaning Bot are you?		
convo0008	alex_neutral	AL-X	The kind programmed to clean up a mess.		
convo0008	seraph_excited	Seraph	A mess they made! 		
convo0008	alex_neutral	AL-X	And now they are attempting to clean you.		
convo0008	seraph_excited	Seraph	I am a dirty boy...		
convo0009	alex_neutral	AL-X	Seraph, there appears to be someting of interest across that gap		
convo0011	alex_neutral	AL-X	You're making excellent progress Seraph. After each check point, if you are disconnected from the Grid I'll be able to reupload you to here.		
convo0011	seraph_excited	Seraph	You want me to upload all over you?		
convo0011	alex_neutral	AL-X	404 Error.		
convo0012	seraph_excited	Seraph	Looks like there's someting tasty at the end of the rainbow.		
convo0013	seraph_excited	Seraph	Ooooo, an iced pumpkin apple chai thai spiced crapa-frappa-ccuino with 25 pumps of organic simple sugar syrup with artifically sweetened quinoa milk topped and a shot of Angry Red Beast energy drink. My fave!		
convo0013	alex_neutral	AL-X	This abomination of a drink appears to restore your enegry levels.		
convo0013	seraph_excited	Seraph	Shots! Shots! Shots! Or Get in my mouth!		
convo0014	alex_neutral	AL-X	Be careful not to rush, Seraph, you may want to time your dash.		
convo0014	seraph_excited	Seraph	I always take my time. I like it slooooow... and then fast at the end!		
convo0015	seraph_excited	Seraph	I didn't realized you were all into group play - am I the star?		
convo0016	seraph_excited	Seraph	Sweet Moses. Princess needs a disco nap?		
convo0016	alex_neutral	AL-X	Seraph, make your way to the Hub. The Grid is not connected to the green spaces, you'll be safe from the Bots there.		
convo0016	seraph_excited	Seraph	Seriously? It's the future. Where's our teleportation machines?! Still waiting...		
convo0017	alex_neutral	AL-X	We can't reach the Hub from here, let's see if there's a way around back.		
convo0017	seraph_excited	Seraph	I prefer the backdoor.		
convo0020	alex_neutral	AL-X	We have successfully made it to the Hub.		
convo0020	seraph_excited	Seraph	The things I do to impress daddy
