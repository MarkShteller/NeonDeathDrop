convo0001	temp.tag	Seraph	Looks like the whole city is F'd in the A with a D		
convo0001	temp.tag	AL-X	Those acronyms do not compute. The Grid is defintley encountering a bug.		
convo0002	temp.tag	AL-X	Seraph, the Grid has been disrupted. There are failures in the flooring tiles. 		
convo0002	temp.tag	Seraph	Now THAT'S a big hole!		
convo0003	temp.tag	AL-X	Seraph, you will not be able to walk across that gap. Try your dash technique. 		
convo0003	temp.tag	Seraph	I prefer to call it a gliding duck walk		
convo0003b	temp.tag	AL-X	Excellent job! Nice achievement. 		
convo0003b	temp.tag	Seraph	This dry robot thing is played out. Dial up the sass.		
convo0003b	temp.tag	AL-X	Slaaaay Bitch!!!		
convo0003b	temp.tag	Seraph	Back three clicks. 		
convo0003b	temp.tag	AL-X	Werk, gurl!		
convo0003b	temp.tag	Seraph	Noice. 		
convo0004	temp.tag	AL-X	That trash can is a bit phish. 		
convo0004	temp.tag	Seraph	Oh snap! That can is shooting trash at me!		
convo0004	temp.tag	AL-X	Try disconnecting it from the Grid.		
convo0005	temp.tag	Seraph	Step off, bitch.		
convo0005	temp.tag	AL-X	That seems to have worked.		
convo0005	temp.tag	Seraph	You put the 'rash' in trash.		
convo0005	temp.tag	AL-X	lol		
convo0005	temp.tag	Seraph	Don't be cute.		
convo0006	temp.tag	AL-X	Seraph, this does not appear to be an isolated case. All of the bots in Bavelle appear to be malfunctioning.		
convo0006	temp.tag	Seraph	So much for going dancing tonightâ€¦		
convo0007	temp.tag	AL-X	You cannot access that bot to disconnect it from the Grid. Best to avoid its projectiles. 		
convo0007	temp.tag	Seraph	But projectiles are the best part.		
convo0008	temp.tag	Seraph	Aren't you cute - want a hug little guy?		
convo0008	temp.tag	AL-X	These bots are not friendly.		
convo0008	temp.tag	Seraph	First you surge then you purge? What sort of Cleaning Bot are you?		
convo0008	temp.tag	AL-X	The kind programmed to clean up a mess.		
convo0008	temp.tag	Seraph	A mess they made! 		
convo0008	temp.tag	AL-X	And now they are attempting to clean you.		
convo0008	temp.tag	Seraph	I am a dirty boy...		
convo0009	temp.tag	AL-X	Seraph, there appears to be someting of interest across that gap		
convo0011	temp.tag	AL-X	You're making excellent progress Seraph. After each check point, if you are disconnected from the Grid I'll be able to reupload you to here.		
convo0011	temp.tag	Seraph	You want me to upload all over you?		
convo0011	temp.tag	AL-X	404 Error.		
convo0012	temp.tag	Seraph	Looks like there's someting tasty at the end of the rainbow.		
convo0013	temp.tag	Seraph	Ooooo, an iced pumpkin apple chai thai spiced crapa-frappa-ccuino with 25 pumps of organic simple sugar syrup with artifically sweetened quinoa milk topped and a shot of Angry Red Beast energy drink. My fave!		
convo0013	temp.tag	AL-X	This abomination of a drink appears to restore your enegry levels.		
convo0013	temp.tag	Seraph	Shots! Shots! Shots! Or Get in my mouth!		
convo0014	temp.tag	AL-X	Be careful not to rush, Seraph, you may want to time your dash.		
convo0014	temp.tag	Seraph	I always take my time. I like it slooooow... and then fast at the end!		
convo0015	temp.tag	Seraph	I didn't realized you were all into group play - am I the star?		
convo0016	temp.tag	Seraph	Sweet Moses. Princess needs a disco nap?		
convo0016	temp.tag	AL-X	Seraph, make your way to the Hub. The Grid is not connected to the green spaces, you'll be safe from the Bots there.		
convo0016	temp.tag	Seraph	Seriously? It's the future. Where's our teleportation machines?! Still waiting...		
convo0017	temp.tag	AL-X	We can't reach the Hub from here, let's see if there's a way around back.		
convo0017	temp.tag	Seraph	I prefer the backdoor.		
convo0020	temp.tag	AL-X	We have successfully made it to the Hub.		
convo0020	temp.tag	Seraph	The things I do to impress daddy
